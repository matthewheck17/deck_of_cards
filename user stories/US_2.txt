As a user, I will be able to click on a card in my hand. Clicking on a card will "select" the given card, 
causing the selected card to move upwards in relation to the other cards. 
    -Clicking on a different card will cause the newly clicked card to move updwards, and at the same time, the card 
    that was originally clicked will move back to its starting position.
    -Clicking anywhere on the screen outside of the selected card will also cause the selected card to 
    be deselected.
