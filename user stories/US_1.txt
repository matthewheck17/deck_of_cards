As a user, within the hearts game, I will be able to push a button that says "Begin" and be able
to be dealt a hand of cards for each player in the Hearts Game. Opposing players' hands will be
face down and the player's hand will be face up. The player will have a stack of cards and be able
to see the top card only.
